# Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
#         For this part the \color{red}{\verb|weekdays()|}weekdays() function may be of some help here.
# Use the dataset with the filled-in missing values for this part.
# 
# Create a new factor variable in the dataset with two levels – “weekday” and “weekend” indicating whether a given date is a weekday or weekend day.
# Make a panel plot containing a time series plot (i.e. type = "l") of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) 
# and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all weekday days or weekend days (y-axis).
# See the README file in the GitHub repository to see an example of what this plot should look like using simulated data.
